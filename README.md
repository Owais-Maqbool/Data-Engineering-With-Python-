This repsitory contains "XML-to-CSV conversion scripts for 'sample.xml' and 'complex.xml'. Pandas DataFrames capture key attributes, saved as 'sample.csv' and 'complex_output.csv.' Facilitates structured data integration into analysis workflows. #Python #DataProcessing #XMLtoCSV"
Description of the tasks performed in the provided Python script:

1. **XML-to-CSV Conversion:**
   - The provided Python scripts, 'sample_xml_to_csv.py' and 'complex_xml_to_csv.py,' are designed to convert XML data into structured CSV files. For 'sample.xml' and 'complex.xml,' the scripts leverage the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module to extract relevant information about products, catalog items, sizes, and color swatches. The extracted data is then organized into Pandas DataFrames, serving as tabular representations.

2. **DataFrame Creation and CSV Output:**
   - The scripts proceed to create Pandas DataFrames from the extracted data, capturing key attributes. The resulting DataFrames are saved as CSV files, 'sample.csv' and 'complex.csv,' respectively. This structured format facilitates seamless integration into data analysis workflows, enabling efficient utilization of the extracted information. To execute these scripts locally, users should replace file paths and ensure the installation of necessary Python packages, including `xml.etree.ElementTree` and `pandas` via `pip install pandas`.
